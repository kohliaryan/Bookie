# Bookie
Bookie is a Python-based project designed to manage book orders and customers in a bookstore. The project includes several classes, including Book, ShoppingCart, Customer, Admin, and Order, each with its own specific functionality. The Book class represents a book in the store's inventory and includes attributes such as the book's title, author, genre, price, and stock. The ShoppingCart class provides a shopping cart implementation for customers to add and remove books from their cart, and to checkout and place orders. The Customer class represents a customer in the system and includes attributes such as the customer's name, email, and address, as well as a ShoppingCart instance. The Admin class represents an administrator in the system and includes attributes such as the administrator's username and password. The Order class represents an order placed by a customer and includes the customer's information, a list of books in the order, and the total cost of the order.

With Bookie, bookstore owners can manage their inventory, customers, and orders with ease. The system provides a user-friendly interface for adding new books, updating stock levels, and tracking customer orders. Customers can browse the bookstore's inventory and add books to their shopping cart, and then checkout and place their order. The system also includes an admin interface for managing user accounts and permissions, and generating reports on inventory and sales. With its modular design and object-oriented approach, Bookie is easy to customize and extend to fit the specific needs of different bookstores. Whether you're managing a small independent bookstore or a large chain, Bookie has the tools you need to run your business efficiently and effectively.
